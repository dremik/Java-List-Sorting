# Java List Sorting

### Functions
This class contains 5 sorting functions: BubbleSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort and CountingSort.
Each one works with lists containing either numbers or strings (even chars).

### Instructions
Import this class in your java package. You can extend ListSorting your class or you can just use ListSorting.function. I reccomend extending your class to this one so you can just use function's name without writing every time the class name.

Hope you guys enjoy!
